# Breath Break

## Introduction

The **Breath Break** project addresses the increasing need for effective heart rate monitoring and stress relief among cardiac patients, particularly those with a history of cardiovascular complications or at high risk of heart attacks. This smart system is designed to assist bed-ridden patients in monitoring their heart rate, detecting potential heart attacks, providing stress relief through breathing exercises, and reminding patients to take their medication on time.

## Key Features

1. **Heart Rate Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitors the patient's heart rate using a heart rate sensor.
   - Detects significant deviations from normal heart rate levels (e.g., tachycardia or bradycardia).
   - Activates alarms and sends email alerts to trusted contacts during potential heart attack scenarios.

2. **Stress Relief Mechanism**:
   - Includes breathing exercises combined with visual aids like nature pictures to help patients relax.
   - Provides live feedback via screen color changes to reflect heart rate levels:
     - **Red**: High stress (HR > 120 bpm).
     - **Yellow**: Normal (60 bpm < HR ≤ 120 bpm).
     - **Green**: Relaxed (HR ≤ 60 bpm).

3. **Medication Reminder**:
   - Allows patients to set alarms for medication intake.
   - Sends email reminders at the designated times to ensure compliance with prescribed medication schedules.

4. **Box Breathing Practice**:
   - Guides users through calming box breathing exercises.
   - Utilizes vibration and visual instructions to create a peaceful environment.

## Problem Definition and Objectives

### Goals:
- **Medication Reminders**: Ensure patients take medication on time via alarms and email notifications.
- **Heart Attack Detection**: Continuously monitor heart rates and alert family members in emergencies.
- **Stress Relief**: Provide accessible relaxation techniques to reduce stress levels and promote heart health.

### Assumptions:
- Device credentials (Wi-Fi, email) are pre-configured and hard-coded.
- The device is in a stable Wi-Fi zone.
- Emergency contact information is pre-set in the code.

## Project Components

1. **User Interface**:
   - A menu displayed on the M5Stack LCD screen with four main buttons: 
     - **Alarm Timer**
     - **Heart Attack**
     - **Stress Relief**
     - **Box Breath**

2. **Heart Attack Detection Algorithm**:
   - Reads heart rate data and calculates averages for every 15 readings.
   - Detects heart attacks based on two consecutive abnormal averages.
   - Alerts via screen vibration and sends an email notification.

3. **Relaxation Algorithm**:
   - Combines breathing exercises with color-coded feedback and nature imagery.
   - Helps reduce stress levels by promoting controlled breathing patterns.

4. **Alarm Functionality**:
   - Users set alarms for medication reminders.
   - Emails are sent at the specified times to ensure compliance.

5. **Box Breathing Practice**:
   - Guides users through breathing exercises with visual aids and vibrations.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - M5Stack Core2
   - MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter
   - Wi-Fi connectivity

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Arduino IDE with relevant libraries (`M5Core2.h`, `WiFiMulti.h`, `ESP_Mail_Client.h`, `MAX30100_PulseOximeter.h`).

3. **Setup**:
   - Configure Wi-Fi credentials and email settings in the code.
   - Upload the program to the M5Stack device.
   - Connect the heart rate sensor and test functionality.

4. **Usage**:
   - **Menu Navigation**: Select options using the LCD touch screen.
   - **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Observe real-time heart rate data and receive alerts for abnormalities.
   - **Stress Relief**: Engage in guided breathing exercises with visual and vibration feedback.
   - **Medication Reminder**: Set alarms to ensure timely medication intake.

## Results and Testing

### Observations:
1. **Heart Attack Detection**:
   - Detected abnormal heart rate changes successfully in test cases.
   - Triggered alarms and email notifications during simulated heart attack scenarios.

2. **Stress Relief Algorithm**:
   - Screen color transitions effectively reflected stress levels during exercises.
   - Significant reductions in heart rate were observed in test subjects.

3. **Medication Reminder**:
   - Emails were sent accurately at the specified alarm times.

### Limitations:
- Heart rate sensor accuracy is limited.
- Issues with SD file attachment and email functionality remain unresolved.
- Speech synthesis functionality could not be implemented due to compatibility issues.
